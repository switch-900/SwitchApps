## Combinio https://github.com/switch-900/combinio
Combinio is a Node.js script designed to aggregate all your projectâ€™s code files into a single combined.txt file. This is particularly useful for utilizing AI tools to review your code structure or for creating a consolidated view of your project.

https://switch-900.github.io/AirDrop/
Airdrop YAML Generator
This project provides a simple web-based tool to generate YAML files required for airdrop operations on an Ordinal node, such as one running on an Umbrel node.

Purpose
The tool is designed to simplify the process of creating YAML files for airdrops by allowing users to input the necessary details and automatically generating the required files. These YAML files can then be used with Ordinal nodes to distribute inscriptions to multiple destination addresses.
