# Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of web applications and projects. This repository showcases tools and platforms I've developed, focusing on blockchain, bitmap technologies, and digital art.

## Blockchain Tools

  A blockchain explorer for Bitcoin transactions and data visualization.

## Bitmap Technology

- [Simple Bitmap](https://switch-900.github.io/SimpleBitmap/)  
  A lightweight tool for creating and editing bitmap images.
- [Bitmap Nexus](https://www.bitmapnexus.com/)  
  A central hub for bitmap-related resources and tools.
- [Oodinals](https://www.oodinals.com/)  
  A search tool for exploring ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## 3D Bitmap Platform

- [3D Bitmap](https://www.3dbitmap.com/)  
  A platform for rendering and visualizing three-dimensional bitmaps.
  - [BitPaint](https://www.3dbitmap.com/bitpaint)  
    A creative tool for digital painting on bitmaps.
  - [Umbrel Integration](https://www.3dbitmap.com/umbrel.html)  
    A guide for integrating 3D Bitmap tools with Umbrel nodes.

## Ord Tools 

- [AirDrop YAML Generator](https://switch-900.github.io/AirDrop/)  
  Simplifies the creation of YAML files for airdrops, enabling distribution of inscriptions to multiple addresses.
- [Parcel Sizer](https://switch-900.github.io/Parcel-Sizer/)  
  Visualizes Bitcoin transaction parcel sizes within a block, inspired by Bitfeed's artistic representation.
- [Parcel Command Generator](https://switch-900.github.io/ParcelGenerator/)  
  Automates the creation of YAML configurations and shell commands for bitmap parcels.

## Ordinals Tools

- [Ordinal Tree](https://ordinals.com/content/d6b2c108f6e2ba3f97cde7774d00dd75b2ee3f7c07740bb216b1b0f65f13d4cai0)  
  Explore hierarchical structures of inscriptions and their children. Features include content navigation, fullscreen mode, and ID copying.
- [Bitmap and Parcel Validator](https://ordinals.com/content/d3b049472e885b65ed0513a675c8e01a28fffe5eb8b347394168048390c8b14ci0)  
  Validates bitmaps and parcels on-chain using ordinal inscriptions.

## BITMAPSAT

- [BITMAPSAT Repository](https://github.com/switch-900/BITMAPSAT)  
  A guide for setting up your digital canvas with features like reinscription updates, smart parcel activation, and real-time synchronization.
- Used in [Blockamoto Concept Map](https://ordinals.com/content/bf50cd2f407491af43c2bb021536f8107c5426f19b26a65a6d6247e2de609ef1i0).
